As part of the assignment a Javadoc must be provided for the program. It can be found in the project's github pages:

...

An example of the deployed .war file can be accessed here:

...

You can host the website yourself by defining and locating the target .war folder, executing the program in your Java IDE and  deploying it onto your server. This is, however, very simplified and you should refer to other sites for more detailed information regarding deployment of .war files if you run into issues. You need to install the following:

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependencies. Necessary.
* [Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) - Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies

Maven is preinstalled in the Netbeans IDE, which is the IDE that was used in the creation of this project. Other IDEs may not.

You'll also need to create your own database connector.

### Acknowledgements

The github page is currently a redirection to the Javadoc. Ultimately, it was never created for anything else. One could argue, that it should function as a hub for the project with graphics.
